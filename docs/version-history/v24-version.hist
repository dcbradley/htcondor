- DAGMan will now periodically print a table regarding states of
  job placed to the Access Point to the debug log (``*.dagman.out``).
  The rate at which this table in printed is dictated by
  :macro:`DAGMAN_PRINT_JOB_TABLE_INTERVAL`
  :jira:`2794`

- The *condor_startd* daemon ad now contains attributes showing the average and total
  bytes transferred to and from jobs during its lifetime.
  :jira:`2721`

- Improved validation and cleanup of :macro:`EXECUTE` directories.
  The :macro:`EXECUTE` directory must now be owned by the *condor* user
  when the daemons are started as root. The condor_startd will
  not attempt to clean an invalid :macro:`EXECUTE` directory nor will
  it alter the file permissions of an :macro:`EXECUTE` directory.
  :jira:`2789`

- The *condor_startd* now advertises a new attribute,
  :ad-attr:`SingularityUserNamespaces` which is true when apptainer
  or singularity work and are using Linux user namespaces, and false
  when it is using setuid mode.
  :jira:`2818`

- For **arc** grid universe jobs, the new submit command
  :subcom:`arc_data_staging` can be used to supply additional elements
  to the DataStaging block of the ARC ADL that HTCondor constructs.
  :jira:`2774`

- For **batch** grid universe jobs, the PATH environment variable values
  from the job ad and the worker node environment are now combined.
  Previously, only the PATH value from the job ad was used.
  The old behavior can be restored by setting blah_merge_paths=no in
  the blah.config file.
  :jira:`2793`

*** 24.4.0 bugs

- Changed the numeric output of :tool:`htcondor` jobs so that the rounding
  to megabytes, gigabytes, etc. matches the binary definitions the rest
  of the tools use.
  :jira:`2788`

*** 24.0.4 bugs

- Fixed a memory leak in the schedd that could be caused by SCHED_CRON
  scripts that generate standard error output.
  :jira:`2817`

- Fixed a bug in the negotiator that caused it to crash when matching
  offline ads.
  :jira:`2819`
